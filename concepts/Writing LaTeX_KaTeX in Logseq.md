## Writing LaTeX/KaTeX in Logseq

Logseq supports mathematical notation and formulas using **KaTeX**, which covers a substantial subset of LaTeX, especially for mathematics.

### Basic Syntax

- **Inline Math:**
Wrap your LaTeX/KaTeX formula in single dollar signs:

```
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
```

This will render as inline math.
- **Block Math:**
For standalone formulas (display mode), use double dollar signs:

```
$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$
```


### Supported Functions

- Logseq relies on KaTeX. While most common LaTeX math commands work, not everything is supported. Full reference for supported commands can be found in the KaTeX documentation[^1_1][^1_2].
- If a function is not rendering, check that it is supported by KaTeX (for example, tables via `\tabular` aren't supported, but array environments work[^1_3]).


### Special Points

- **Macros:**
KaTeX macros can be used in Logseq by defining them inline with `\def` or `\newcommand` within your formula. However, global macros (usable across the whole graph) are not natively supported, though some community plugins provide more features[^1_4][^1_5].
- **Chemical Equations:**
Extensions like `mhchem` are supported for chemical notation in KaTeX[^1_6].
- **Whiteboards and Blocks:**
For whiteboard mode, the easiest method is to create a new block with your formula using the same math delimiters[^1_7].


### Limitations

- Only the math portion of LaTeX is supported—not full document formatting.
- Some LaTeX packages and environments are not available.
- KaTeX is the engine, so reference the [KaTeX supported functions][^1_2].


### Quick Reference Table

| What you want | How to type it in Logseq | Output style |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Inline formula | `$E = mc^2$` | Inline |
| Displayed formula | `$E = mc^2$` | Block (centered) |
| Math macro (inline) | `$\def\X{\text{X-value}} x+\X$` | Custom macro within formula |
| Chemical equations | `$$\ce{H2O}$` | Chemical notation (with mhchem) |

### Further Reading

- To see which commands are available, consult the [KaTeX supported functions][^1_2].
- For plugin enhancements and real-time preview, explore community plugins such as `logseq-live-math`[^1_8].

In summary, **wrap your formula in `$...$` or `$...$`**, use KaTeX/LaTeX math notation, and refer to the KaTeX documentation if a command doesn't render as expected[^1_9][^1_1][^1_2].

# give me its katex form λ3−(trace)λ2+(sum of minors)λ−det(A)

The **KaTeX** (or LaTeX) form for the characteristic polynomial of a \$ 3 \times 3 \$ matrix $A$ with the structure:

**λ³ − (trace) λ² + (sum of minors) λ − det(A)**

is:

```latex
\lambda^3 - (\operatorname{tr}A)\lambda^2 + (S)\lambda - \det(A)
```

where:

- **$\operatorname{tr}A$** is the trace (sum of diagonal elements).
- **$S$** is the sum of principal minors of order 2 (that is, the sum of determinants of all $2×2$ principal submatrices)[^2_1].


### In KaTeX (for Logseq), type:

```
\lambda^3 - (\operatorname{tr}A)\lambda^2 + (\text{sum of minors})\,\lambda - \det(A)
```

or, if you want to use a variable for the "sum of minors", such as \$ S \$:

```
\lambda^3 - (\operatorname{tr}A)\lambda^2 + S\lambda - \det(A)
```

This format is valid and supported by KaTeX in Logseq[^2_3][^2_8].

# explain minors and cofactors concept in matrix briesfly

**Minors** and **cofactors** are concepts used in matrices, especially when calculating determinants, adjoints, and inverses.

- **Minor**:
The **minor** of an element in a matrix is the determinant of the smaller square matrix formed by deleting the element's row and column from the original matrix. For example, for element \$ a_{ij} \$, its minor \$ M_{ij} \$ is the determinant of the matrix that remains after removing the \$ i \$-th row and \$ j \$-th column[^3_1][^3_4][^3_7][^3_8].
- **Cofactor**:
The **cofactor** of an element \$ a_{ij} \$, denoted \$ C_{ij} \$, is calculated by multiplying its minor \$ M_{ij} \$ by \$ (-1)^{i+j} \$, where \$ i \$ and \$ j \$ are the row and column numbers:

$$
C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}
$$

This sign factor alternates according to the position of the element within the matrix[^3_1][^3_4][^3_8][^3_5].

**In short:**

- **Minor** = determinant of the submatrix after removing a row and column.
- **Cofactor** = minor, adjusted by a plus or minus sign determined by its position.
