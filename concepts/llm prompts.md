## notes for logseq
	- I want to create structured study notes from my previous conversations with you about  linear algebra.
	  
	  Please generate a Logseq-compatible Markdown  note that:
	- Organizes content as bullet points and sub-points using Logseq's outline format.
	- Summarizes key concepts, definitions, and important formulas (use KaTeX/LaTeX syntax where needed).
	- Emphasizes my doubts and misconceptions clearly under a “❓ My Doubts” section.
	- Provides clear, step-by-step explanations and solutions under a “✅ Solution Steps” section.
	- Highlights important concepts under a “⭐ Key Points” section.
	- Includes a “📋 Summary” section at the end for quick revision.
	  
	  Use clear headings, subheadings, and indentations to make the notes structured for Logseq.
