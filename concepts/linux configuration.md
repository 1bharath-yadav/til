### [[Jul 17th, 2025]]  syncthing for logseq data in hyprland config super+alt+N
collapsed:: true
	-
	- changing configuration to not auto start browser in ~/.local/state/syncthing/config.xml
- Here's a summary of what I've done:
   1. Set up a Kitty shell wrapper (/home/archer/bin/kitty-zsh-wrapper.sh) to automatically log every terminal session into
      /home/archer/logs/terminal_sessions/.
   2. Added a hook to your .zshrc to include detailed metadata (timestamp, command, directory) in the logs.
   3. Created a two-part summarization script (daily-terminal-summary.sh and summarize_logs.py) in /home/archer/bin/.
   4. Set up a uv Python environment in /home/archer/bin/ and installed the litellm dependency there.
   5. Configured and enabled a systemd user service (daily-terminal-summary.service) that will run once automatically when you log in.
      It will check for the previous day's logs and, if found, summarize them into a Markdown file in
      /home/archer/til/terminal_summaries/.
- Important next steps for you:
- 1. Set API Key: The summarization script requires your Gemini API key. You must set it as an environment variable. Add the following
      line to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.env file:
- 1     export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
- Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual key.
